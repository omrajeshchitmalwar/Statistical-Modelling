## 🛠️ Data Analysis Steps
#### 📦 Import Libraries:
- pandas: Used for data manipulation, reading CSV files, creating DataFrames, handling missing values, etc. <br>
- matplotlib.pyplot: Used for creating various plots and visualizations like histograms, scatter plots, etc. <br>
- seaborn: Used for advanced data visualization and creating attractive statistical graphics. <br>
- statsmodels.api: Used for various statistical functions and model fitting in statsmodels. <br>
- sklearn: Used for machine learning algorithms, including regression analysis. <br>
#### 🧹 Data Collection and Cleaning:
- Load the music dataset from a CSV file. <br>
- Check for missing values and handle them by filling or removing. <br>
- Drop unnecessary columns and clean data as needed. <br>
- Convert data types and prepare the dataset for analysis. <br>
#### 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Visualize the distribution of music popularity scores to identify trends and patterns. <br>
- Create a correlation matrix to understand relationships between numerical features. <br>
#### 📈 Regression Analysis:
- Define features and target for regression model. <br>
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets. <br>
- Standardize the features for better model performance. <br>
- Build and fit a linear regression model. <br>
- Evaluate the model using metrics like mean squared error and R-squared. <br>
#### 📊 Visualization:
- Plot actual vs. predicted popularity scores. <br>
- Visualize relationships between features and popularity using scatter plots and segmented analysis for explicit and non-explicit tracks. <br>
